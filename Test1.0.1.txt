Q	it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi-mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
Q	a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
Q	the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm-2 sm-3 or sm-6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg-51 capability ddg 1000's advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability

Q	for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24-hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
Q	during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
Q	both of these businesses are co-operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherford's odour issues and that's a very positive outcome
Q	we were able to analyse four samples from our odour-capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporation's sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
Q	based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
Q	hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible

Q	but it wasn't like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
Q	we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed

Q	i've never done anything like this before
Q	my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but i'm really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully they'll be kinder to me than i am on myself and that's part of the therapy
Q	i've been listening to carol on the radio for years but i've never seen her so this has been a great experience
Q	because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
Q	one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed you're being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
Q	also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but it's a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
Q	and for people who have life-long self-esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
Q	this is why i work in radio and not television

Q	it's a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because we're so diverse and the community don't really have an understanding of what we do
Q	the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
Q	disability services like mai-wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
Q	this is a one-off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
Q	this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand

Q	it's a privilege for me to open it
Q	there shouldn't be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation

Q	hearing that was a disorienting blast from my past
Q	so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
Q	well sort of
Q	ya see back in the day i worked a few non-commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory it's throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio-in-the-ear of the listener really shifted persona-frontin to a whole new realm
Q	mr radio historia-phila-dr ya-know could you just answer the question who is this guy
Q	oh yah right i'm not sure

Q	coop you had a pretty tough time out in california didn't you
Q	well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
Q	wow that was something
Q	do you see that happen often
Q	well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you don't see the blood but usually you don't have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
Q	hey if you don't mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
Q	actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy-six thousand a year selling the seats
Q	seventy-six thousand braid that is just mad
Q	yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
Q	well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
Q	people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can
Q	hey can i have my antenna back i'm gettin a lot of echo
Q	coop look i gotta go check on my patrons see if the silk-splattered one is ok they're calling me down hey let me just give ya a tip stay out of the tree climbing and try and dig up some of your old airchecks they will probably remind and jog a lot of memories for you and help explain the package delivery

Q	we've seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
Q	phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
Q	mars is giving us some surprises
Q	we're excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice-rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing we've done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but we're finding ways to work with it and we're gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
Q	it's a 30-watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
Q	the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice-dominated terrain as far as the eye can see

Q	refused to identify any of these donors
Q	why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
Q	williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
Q	we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
Q	we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar

Q	the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer let's create a wave of donors

Q	since 1957 when there weren't any seniors
Q	we've got a lot of young guys so there's going to be a lot of anticipation a lot of guys ready to step up and play
Q	so there's definitely a lot of emotion going around so that's good
Q	this group will have a great work ethic and this group will have a great spirit about it
Q	now what we've got to do is get to the point where we play well
Q	this time last year we had a lot of them that were absolutely clueless because everything was new
Q	just the difference a year makes in the system we're light years from where we were terminology-wise and mentally
Q	you're able to get into a lot more detail sooner
Q	last year you were just trying to teach them the big picture where at least now they've got a little bit of a grasp of it and you can be a little more thorough
Q	i want to make sure that we're getting guys that you feel like really have a strong chance to be good players here
Q	and i think each guy gets more repetitions each guy gets more teaching each guy gets more coaching
Q	once we do put the bolts on the helmets if a guy hasn't earned them then he'll be a bald falcon

Q	i started bernard hopkins and i managed former super middleweight champion steve little and eddie has more natural talent than anyone i have managed
Q	we want to fight anyone anywhere
Q	i see guys like ruiz valuev toney amp barrett getting opportunity after opportunity and that shuts out guys like me who lost one fight that i know i could have and should have won

Q	hot fights summer in the city
Q	james is a very fan-friendly fighter whose body attack alone makes him entertaining every time out his vast wealth of amateur experience provides a solid foundation for him he's the type of fighter who adds value to every card he appears on
Q	i love his body punching when you combine that with his tenacity in the ring it is hard to imagine him ever being in a bad fight
Q	that shows me that james is a real fighter i hope to do lots more fights with him in the future he was willing to get right back on the horse against a guy who is not a pitty-pat opponent
Q	james is a very rugged and crowd pleasing fighter he sells a lot of tickets and has a lot of enthusiastic fans he generates excitement
Q	there's no doubt that james can come back and be a world champion someday he's very strong-willed and has a ton of guts and determination i'll be rooting for him he's a dynamite fighter and a great guy

Q	fighter of the year
Q	the latin fake
Q	this time last year i was supposed to be fighting a legitimate ex-champ in kassim ouma on a pay-per-view undercard
Q	that fight got cancelled but this time i'm in against a more respected ex-champ in vernon forrest a future hall of famer and our fight is the co-feature so it's an even bigger fight
Q	this time around were fighting on my side of the tracks which means i'll come with more aggression and more machismo i know vernon will come with more hunger but i'm a young hungry undefeated champion now and i'm going to stay that way
Q	he fought a great fight but he fought a vernon forrest who was at 45
Q	i had a bad night that night i had a terrible night the worst of my career it was like i was fighting in quicksand but on sept 13th mora will fight the vernon forrest he expected in june i'll be at 100
Q	that's bulls t
Q	everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first-hand when they fight me
Q	it had nothing to do with style
Q	all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldn't give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
Q	people think i grew old overnight
Q	it's a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
Q	this time i'll limit how much i'll train for the fight
Q	his style stinks
Q	it's as bad as mayorga's
Q	i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do it's just that physically i couldn't adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
Q	vernon's very sly
Q	he's a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch that's why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
Q	i think it's going to be a more exciting fight this time
Q	i see in his eyes that i hurt his pride by beating him
Q	i'm going to be more aggressive i'm going to throw more right hands and go to the body i'm not going to hold back like i did the first time it's mexican independence day weekend so i don't mind being a little macho or spilling a little blood
Q	i won big money on that fight
Q	i knew it was going to happen the eventual stoppage of cotto i've sparred with margarito for years sometimes he has good days sometimes i have good days but it's always a war with him
Q	i remember the first time i sparred with him was in 1999 in oscar de la hoya's camp for ike quartey

Q	i have fought some rough and tough fighters but he's the dirtiest fighter there is
Q	there was no way he was gonna beat me anyway
Q	i was too smart too fast too experienced if i kept on hitting him i would have killed him
Q	i don't have a problem with it
Q	if perry thinks that hector did something illegal then it should be taken to appeal
Q	he does absolutely anything to get you off your game
Q	he head-butted me so much i have a crack in the front of my skull

Q	sure your tires are properly inflated
Q	we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
Q	obama's solution to america's energy crisis is inflating tires maybe he's been out of the country too long
Q	running a tire 20 percent underinflated only 5 to 7 pounds per square inch psi can increase fuel consumption by 10 percent that can easily cost motorists two or three miles per gallon not only that but running underinflated also reduces the tire's tread life

Q	they approached me yesterday afternoon
Q	we didn't have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
Q	he was a little bit surprised maybe
Q	he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think it's a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him that's got to be a good feeling for him i guess
Q	it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
Q	it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine i'm upset that he's leaving but it's a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
Q	he wasn't having his best year but he was just getting hot
Q	you won't be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr it's the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
Q	he's one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
Q	i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all-star game it doesn't make sense to me that he would be available
Q	we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
Q	we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didn't it's our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didn't come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
Q	we had conversations that went right down to the wire
Q	and whenever you have that obviously you feel like there's a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and we've worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didn't find something that lined up for us
Q	i'm not going to address speculation
Q	i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
Q	we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
Q	that's fair to say
Q	the last four or five days obviously we've been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
Q	but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal

Q	he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
Q	we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim-bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
Q	i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
Q	having a by-election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing one's personal ambitions
Q	they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
Q	maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
Q	umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
Q	in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
Q	the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi's leadership is more stable
Q	we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory

Q	it has been sheer madness
Q	my team and i have been working on super-tight schedules since the show started there is hardly any room for us to breathe between each episode
Q	honestly styling is one of the toughest jobs around but it doesn't discriminate they love you and your work because you make them beautiful inside and out it's not all about hanging out with celebrities or anything like that
Q	we are working under a lot of constraints and stress i constantly remind my team to keep within the dress code as it would determine the success of the show
Q	the backstage normally transforms into a war zone every week we cut snip and even burn some of the costumes to achieve the perfect look for the contestants two weeks ago jimmy had to burn a corset to de-stress the lace and mind you the garment looked good after that
Q	oh my it was so funny as i had the half-ready hat perpetually placed on my head while i continued altering it in front of the mirror at home the whole night

Q	the winds were medium to strong 12 18 knots and later in the afternoon the waters got rather rough
Q	we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
Q	when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
Q	i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days

Q	it's no secret that we're not satisfied by how the last five races went
Q	i was particularly disappointed after the series montreal-magny-cours-silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didn't go the right way and i lost
Q	i never let myself be influenced by tension and i won't start now i've just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race that's what i've done every time i was in trouble
Q	it's still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
Q	and it's useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end we'll do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so it's important to always gain points
Q	excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon
Q	the race at hockenheim was the most difficult moment of the season
Q	i was really frustrated and disappointed that i couldn't find the right balance of the car but now we're in a much better position
Q	we had a productive test at jerez especially on the second day the team have done some great work in the development of the f2008 and i'm confident for hungary

Q	heart of umno
Q	what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
Q	if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
Q	you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
Q	during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether we've eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
Q	there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
Q	that was not passed as the division felt it was not the party's place to force them to do it
Q	but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
Q	many do not understand how the hierarchy works
Q	if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
Q	these days branch members are professionals and they know the party's history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what i'm about and whom i support for this or that post
Q	if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the party's direction

Q	how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
Q	councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
Q	rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
Q	cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state government's recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils don't support but will have to fund
Q	if the government supports ipart's recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
Q	while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
Q	the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
Q	councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs

Q	this is a huge victory for consumers
Q	not only did this case generate an extensive record showing that these fees are not really used to subsidize wireless phones but are instead simply used to lock consumers into contracts contract law says that's illegal let's hope the fcc doesn't turn around and give the wireless industry a get out of court free card

Q	last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and it's part of an experiment they're doing they're trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
Q	the course is playing tough
Q	i'm not saying it's playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
Q	you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup that's as wonderful as this
Q	the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
Q	it was risky but it paid off
Q	the guy that's won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
Q	it's just a good course
Q	it's got length it's got rough it's got tough greens so you need to be on your game

Q	since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
Q	that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid-range and high-end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
Q	smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year-over-year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
Q	however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high-end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high-level operating system we expect the competition at the high-end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher-end devices

Q	see what you're dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
Q	the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
Q	oh because at st david's we don't do heart transplants
Q	well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
Q	look i don't like what i'm seeing here
Q	but i'm also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if they're rejecting it isn't a big deal but with you phil the risk is five-fold and it's by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isn't good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially i'm going in there and taking bites out of your heart i'm telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies they'd rather not know what's going on
Q	because given all you have atrial-fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something we've never seen before
Q	if we do the biopsy hopefully we'll be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
Q	another thing to consider
Q	is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant won't fix and some people don't want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy i'll let you two talk it over
Q	i want to know
Q	stephanie i just have to say it one thing i'm scared about is that i'm going to die tomorrow

Q	my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
Q	twenty-nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
Q	we have an epidemic here
Q	women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
Q	i don't know what you're trying to cover up here but we're not going to allow it
Q	this is unacceptable
Q	these actions by the defense department are inexplicable
Q	the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
Q	even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and it's a betrayal of the army's core values
Q	i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
Q	maria to connect the dots
Q	the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
Q	maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you i'm here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
Q	i was raped while i slept
Q	he still comes after me in my dreams
Q	occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
Q	at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
Q	most but not all commanders support the programs
Q	left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
Q	what's at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
Q	when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own

Q	o tribunal constitucional pronunciou-se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico-administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
Q	devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico-institucional
Q	trata-se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
Q	em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
Q	nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
Q	o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
Q	quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
Q	no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro-ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
Q	a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
Q	o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
Q	entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico-administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
Q	semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
Q	devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
Q	no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
Q	sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
Q	n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro-ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
Q	mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
Q	consequ ncias negativas
Q	por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
Q	considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
Q	por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
Q	por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
Q	face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
Q	incerteza dos tempos modernos
Q	petrifica o de normas jur dicas
Q	eterniza o da sua vig ncia
Q	a altera o do estatuto pol tico-administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa

Q	furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
Q	our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
Q	the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
Q	where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
Q	an absolute priority
Q	clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
Q	this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi-disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important

Q	blogmeister would you have a few minutes to spend with me today
Q	who are you and where and when would you like to meet
Q	oh i will explain all of that to you shortly would now be convenient
Q	welcome blogmeister may we get down to business now would you like a drink before we start it is a little bit too early for the hard stuff but would you like a coffee with cream and sugar and a strawberry peek frean's fruit creme cookie
Q	i am the commander in chief of the joint task force set up by windsor police opp rcmp and canadian forces that are surrounding the windsor star building in downtown windsor are you and gord henderson working together along with the posse of windsor star whining and naysaying reporters who have seized control of the windsor star editorial board
Q	you have got to be kidding you know i cannot answer that question first of all i am a lawyer and would have to protect any information about whom i am acting for or even if i am acting for a particular person but more importantly i believe in freedom of the blog it is a variation of freedom of the press and i have no intention of revealing any sources or giving out any confidential information
Q	thanks to you i have just won a big bottle of canadian club i bet with my colleagues that you would say that our bet was a bottle of rye whiskey as you know one is either a rye man or a scotch man as for me unless i put in some mix to kill the taste i would never drink scotch
Q	please blogmeister we think you are the only one who can help us we have read your blogs you are the only one in windsor and essex county who seems to understands the windsor star and its main columnist gord henderson in particular
Q	betting on a vision
Q	is that all that you want
Q	you did not need to go to all of this drama for that you could have just waited a few hours until my next blog came out
Q	we know that you spent five years working on one of the world's largest private white collar bankruptcies two years of it in london england we know that you managed a hundred or more professionals around the world working under you and that you helped coordinate a worldwide seizure by various police forces of documents on the same day and at the same time it was unprecedented henderson's fixation on scotch whiskey and malt whiskey specifically intrigued us because one of the claims to fame of the hotel that you stayed at in london was its world famous scotch malt bar we assumed that he was signalling you since he would have thought that only you two knew that
Q	arthur a reader with a dry wit and a nice touch with words contacted me wednesday to express deep skepticism about the marina and canal being touted for the near west
Q	but not everyone is as convinced
Q	in a subsequent conversation with mayor eddie francis i confessed to having rashly placed my wallet and a piece of my scottish heritage at risk
Q	double the odds double down raise it to a case i'd take the bet because it will be done before i leave office
Q	dave cooke as head of the feasibility task force is no idle dreamer he's a hard-nosed pragmatist who wouldn't put his hard-won reputation on the line if he didn't believe this was achievable and would bring real benefits to windsor
Q	another is early evidence of solid council support i spoke with six of the seven councillors who participated in the rollout at the art gallery and heard enthusiastic support from all of them in other words if it's technically and fiscally feasible a majority is on board
Q	gord henderson would not even look at marra today
Q	london free press october 31 2006
Q	legally if i want to tear down 25 buildings downtown there's nothing you can do about it
Q	apprehension of bias
Q	fari sic is offering both enthusiasm and feasibility study funding
Q	there are serious technical problems beginning with a major sanitary sewer running east-west along riverside drive
Q	washington grand rapids mayor george heartwell told the senate wednesday that
Q	there are good reasons why the original native american tribes settled in this area why the explorers came why people settled here and built their cities and why the area continues to provide a very high quality of life and economic well being for millions of people
Q	the thing that's a bit more challenging is the portion near caron and the old railway cut because that will require a lot of excavation to bring the river water in
Q	also included in brook's concept is conversion of a three-block stretch of either pitt street or chatham street into a new east-west 20-foot-deep canal filled with municipal not detroit river water that eventually travels north back toward the riverfront on property just west of the art gallery
Q	go big or go home
Q	calvin brook the award-winning toronto urban designer who conceived this plan
Q	i tend to assume he has his ducks already lined up
Q	mpp sandra pupatello l windsor west who spoke to francis about the plan a few months ago
Q	brook said he got involved at the urging of mayor eddie francis who asked him to look at other cities such as san antonio famous for its canal-centred urban village area and develop a riverwalk area
Q	you have thoroughly analyzed the situation blogmeister but we are no further ahead than we started we just cannot figure out what henderson is doing
Q	of course not
Q	he is not supposed to make life easy for the likes of people like you and me he is there to keep the star's circulation up at a time when people might not want to spend money on a star subscription he has to keep you guessing now doesn't he

Q	cranbrook is in total agreement to return the remains
Q	the hardest part in the repatriation process is getting the museum to agree with you and cranbrook has already done that
Q	we feel it is the right thing to do we don't need the law to tell us that
Q	we are a museum and institute which feels very strongly about cultural rights heritage and history of native americans on a global scale we view remains as people not research objects
Q	it's impossible to ascertain who these remains belong to but they have been determined to be native american they are from michigan and based on those facts alone we believe they are affiliated with anishnaabek
Q	it could be from all of the bands or one of them we believe our best line of evidence is we were here a substantial amount of time before european contact
Q	i feel really confident the review board will give us the recommendation and that this will be a success
Q	once the case is in our favor it's a formality where the remains are buried

Q	we have water
Q	we've seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
Q	phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
Q	mars is giving us some surprises
Q	we're excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice-rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing we've done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but we're finding ways to work with it and we're gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
Q	it's a 30-watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
Q	the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice-dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
Q	they help us plan measurements we're making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale

Q	if we come to the crunch about issues like taiwan tibet things where we are strategic competitors in a way and we don't agree does that mean we are going to be very muted in our response that we're going to be obliged to react less strongly than we did before

Q	y de los nueve casos que se conocen agrega el m dico cinco fueron descubiertos en espa a
Q	para que el organismo pueda llegar a una respuesta inflamatoria explica el doctor rodrigo alguien le tiene que avisar al sistema inmune para que lance su defensa
Q	pero en estos ni os falla una de las mol culas encargadas de avisar al sistema inmune de la presencia de una infecci n y de que debe responder a ella
Q	lo que nos sorprendi encontrar fue que a diferencia de los ni os los animales resultaron susceptibles a infecciones de todo tipo de virus bacterias etc
Q	pero el ser humano al parecer s lo es susceptible al estafilococo y neumococo cuando falla este gen as que ahora estamos tratando de descubrir porqu ocurre esto

T	2008-08-01 00:02:09
Q	we have to remember that the model is not the disease
Q	if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
Q	after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy that's when the disorders manifest
Q	our thinking is that postpartum depression and maybe premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be due to impaired trafficking of these gaba receptors to the neural membrane
Q	we don't know if this is the same mechanism in humans but i think all indications are there
Q	the women that are affected by the disorder the hormone levels are not changed they are not different than in unaffected women so we are confident that it must be the receptor trafficking mechanism that is affected because the changes in hormone levels are pretty normal

Q	there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
Q	they have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events

Q	it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
Q	photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera

Q	the golden calf
Q	our average loan size is 5m so we aren't going to have thousands of clients
Q	we deal with everybody but we don't make loans below 250 000 simply because we're just not geared to that level of business
Q	that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on
Q	that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we don't tend to do the smaller entry-level type works
Q	no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
Q	you can't be a collector by just looking around and picking things
Q	the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that they're not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isn't collecting

Q	the victorians called this new phenomenon retirement

Q	despite the years of argument about national insurance and the importance of contributions it had no contribution condition

Q	is held to no standard at all
Q	obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
Q	to be clear barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
Q	obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn
Q	obama claims he will work to remove the provision granting immunity to law breakers but the fact remains that obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
Q	that's the best thing that happened to me people are angry about this here's a man who has not served his district and obama is messing in our local business
Q	the level of loyalty directed towards obama defies logic
Q	black folks are all too happy to go along with any treatment that obama chooses to mete out
Q	if obama were already president dissidents would have cause to shop for a safehouse or foreign getaway
Q	the treachery didn't stop with illegal government surveillance regina thomas is a black state senator in georgia running in a democratic primary against white conservative congressman john barrow obama recently endorsed barrow and recorded a radio ad in support of his campaign
Q	politics as usual
Q	spook that sat by the oval office door and slyly make everything alright for them once he gets in
Q	millions of people have deliberately made their needs subservient to those of a politician who cares nothing about them the damage done by jim crow america's apartheid is never ending the desire to see a black face in a high place is an understandable one after so many decades of exclusion but it is still dangerous to accept this misguided concept
Q	independent presidential candidate ralph nader accused sen
Q	there's only one thing different about barack obama when it comes to being a democratic presidential candidate he's half african-american
Q	whether that will make any difference i don't know i haven't heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead what's keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white he doesn't want to appear like jesse jackson we'll see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards
Q	i mean first of all the number one thing that a black american politician aspiring to the presidency should be is to candidly describe the plight of the poor especially in the inner cities and the rural areas and have a very detailed platform about how the poor is going to be defended by the law is going to be protected by the law and is going to be liberated by the law
Q	haven't heard a thing
Q	he wants to show that he is not a threatening another politically threatening african-american politician
Q	he wants to appeal to white guilt you appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful black is powerful basically he's coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether it's corporate or whether it's simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
Q	a flip-flop of epic proportions noting that obama s argument about a gop financial advantage was
Q	the year public financing died
Q	damaging to working people
Q	i won't shop there
Q	sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified
Q	osborne and others suggested the endorsement was a reward for barrow throwing his superdelegate vote to obama thomas did not back obama until around the time he locked up the nomination
Q	how hard is it for you to understand that obama is not black he is half black he owes no allegiance to the black community and in the business of politics i better damn well not see any alliances not related to philosophy and principles
Q	giving the brotha a break
Q	wait until he get in and then we'll hold him accountable
Q	basically he's coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether it's corporate or whether it's simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
Q	republicans for obama is a grassroots organization of proud party members who all share one important trait
Q	its not the potus job to lead the black liberation movement
Q	revise history was what i said not true were the leaders of movement politicians or were they regular people
Q	weren't you supporting obama it seems that you have revised your previous position
Q	learning that i like him even more
Q	lucky you you have someone you can believe in
Q	mother of all crimes
Q	treatise in stupidity
Q	you have to acknowledge that the idea that all africans should have been unified is wrong because africa is a diverse continent with many cultures and differences why would they have banded together
Q	and other enemies of humanity as well
Q	we don't need people we need checks
Q	i don't care if you are poor you can still send my campaign 5 or 10 dollars

Q	that is when most problems occur when people go to the newer versions you'll always hear when a new one comes out it's got some bugs in it still that is just because there are so many kinds of computers they couldn't possibly test everything even though they try
Q	i see that every day the only thing any warranty is going to cover is hardware-related basically the manufacturer warranty will cover hardware but not software
Q	software support is a lot more time consuming than your standard tech support a lot of it is user error you almost have to try to train the person how to use the software in order to make everything work the way it is supposed to
Q	you can google your problem and end up with all kinds of resources but it is going to be mixed in with useless information and people trying to charge you stuff
Q	a lot of this really does come back to computer literacy
Q	they cut down on printing these big volumes of manuals that never were used we have a saying that probably less than 10 percent of people ever cracked their manual especially if everything is going right you don't look for it until something goes wrong
Q	let's say you have a hewlett-packard computer and you call hp technical support they won't tell you they are going to charge you but however long you are on the phone if it is a half hour they end up billing it to the phone bill they find out later that that one half-hour call cost them x number of dollars
Q	once things go wrong and you've exhausted your resources just like when you are sick sometimes you have to call the doctor sometimes you need somebody to help you out because it's keeping you from getting your work done

Q	this fall there's going to be a lot of energy surrounding the obama campaign and we need to find ways to generate a substantial amount of energy around the mccain campaign and an effective dynamic different kind of vice presidential nominee i think would make a difference
Q	a mother of five is a genuine alaskan is a hunter is a dogsledder is very much for drilling for oil has a great reform reputation took on big oil on behalf of the people of alaska

Q	the definition of fearless
Q	when you shake hands with her
Q	just remember where those hands have been
Q	i've been telling my agent for years that i wanted an action movie but no one saw me like that
Q	two weeks before my 40th birthday i guess i'd given up i mean how many action roles are there for women over 40 soon after that i got a call to say they were considering me for the part
Q	i said to her you're so well respected why would you wanna do this giant popcorn movie she told me that after seeing raiders of the lost ark all her friends wanted to be karen allen but she wanted to be harrison ford i knew that was the way i wanted to go
Q	i knew from the start i couldn't fill rachel's shoes
Q	she's so pretty and such an ingenue but i played evie more like katharine hepburn at 40 she has a grown-up kid a 20-year marriage she's a bit more cynical she dreams of being someone like rachel weisz
Q	i'd given birth to my son the year before and i was about 40lbs overweight
Q	she's just the nastiest
Q	so many actors say you have to find something you like in each character i've never bought that i think there are people in the world who are plain mean not many but some so that's how i decided to play her-without sympathy
Q	we should understand a little less and condemn a little more
Q	i don't live with my characters
Q	i can't take them home i'm a mother
Q	all the films i like are escapist i don't want to have reality thrown in my face when i go to the cinema i've never been a cinephile my friends give me dvds of bergman or truffaut and i never watch them
Q	when i brought boyfriends home they would ask me why is everyone shouting
Q	guess what this is pretty fascinating i was going back to new york for a few weeks and a friend suggested i perform some ritual to thank the universe for my good luck so i brought my gold shoe along i got a piece of cardboard and wrote on it miracle shoe size 8 if this shoe fits you please take it it brought me good luck and now i want to pass it on to you whoever you are i don't know who got it i put it right next to a methadone clinic so maybe it's gone to someone who's really struggling when i left i was crying with joy at being able to pass it on

Q	if it ain't broke don't fix it
Q	it was quite a crazy radical move
Q	it was just five months before the qualifying window for the 2008 olympics opened and it seemed crazy for a seasoned shooter like me to undergo a total change from my shooting style to my equipment
Q	i had to un-learn and re-learn everything over a span of 15 months basically whatever i'd learnt through trial and error over the last 20-odd years had to be thrown out
Q	marcello stressed a lot on my shooting stance and the timing
Q	every shot i took was carefully structured and prepared unlike the past when i'd just turn up and shoot
Q	his attention to detail is also very great he would make me shoot the same target at the same trajectory over and over again until i got it right
Q	it was very intense and there were moments of friction between us
Q	marcello also knew when to take it easy sometimes he would take all of us into town and head for this spa for elderly people for us to relax
Q	i don't know if it is going to be my last olympics it will depend on what resources are available
Q	but if there are better trap shooters then i would be happy to make way for them

Q	for us to get the second round we're getting some really good teams
Q	it's going to be great games in our pool and with the international diversity of south florida a lot of people are going to see their countries play whether it's the dominican or venezuela puerto rico u s a canada
Q	people are going to come out and watch these games and the passion for their country will certainly be on display
Q	i think by baseball selecting us it's sending a nice message to everybody about how strongly they feel about miami and the support we have for baseball
Q	i think it exemplifies mlb's dedication to miami and i think it's a great step for us
Q	i think it's huge
Q	we have to sell baseball at the grassroots level and our fan base has to grow significantly by the time we get into the new facility and the more people who are exposed to baseball i think it helps us sell the game to people and helps people become a fan of baseball
Q	i was confident that we had a really good chance just because the efforts and the quality of our proposal both financially and with the detail we attended to it
Q	i feel like we responded very favorably to all the expectations
Q	this is the gateway to the americas and i think it was a natural destination for mlb
Q	we hope so
Q	we hope to demonstrate the uniqueness of our location the quality of the diversity of this marketplace and we think that combination with the timing of the season with tourism at its peak can generate positive results
Q	i think they'll be highly motivated to think about us again in the future to host the games

Q	they approached me yesterday afternoon
Q	we didn't have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
Q	he was a little bit surprised maybe
Q	he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think it's a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him that's got to be a good feeling for him i guess
Q	it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
Q	it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine i'm upset that he's leaving but it's a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
Q	he wasn't having his best year but he was just getting hot
Q	you won't be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr it's the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
Q	he's one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
Q	i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all-star game it doesn't make sense to me that he would be available
Q	we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
Q	we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didn't it's our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didn't come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
Q	we had conversations that went right down to the wire
Q	and whenever you have that obviously you feel like there's a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and we've worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didn't find something that lined up for us
Q	i'm not going to address speculation
Q	i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
Q	we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
Q	that's fair to say
Q	the last four or five days obviously we've been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
Q	but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal

Q	you're sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
Q	we heard this blood-curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
Q	there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
Q	we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
Q	all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
Q	the guy came to the front of the door with buddy's head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
Q	he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident
Q	we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
Q	this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one-of-a-kind in canadian history
Q	due to the rural nature of our network airport-type security is not practical it's a very different type of system

Q	we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
Q	he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didn't say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood-curdling scream

Q	there's got to be some changes to the investigation process allowing for some sort of civilian investigation especially in really serious allegations in-custody deaths and serious injuries
Q	these are the cases that immediately should be taken out of the hands of internal police forces
Q	that's what's been difficult about the system
Q	it's people wanting that satisfaction having an honest belief that what they really want is for the officer not to do that again and be disciplined for what they thought was wrong and just not having an avenue to do it
Q	one of the changes that i'm personally aware of is increasing the oversight role of the office of the police complaint commissioner throughout the process of an investigation so it will provide additional independent oversight pretty much from the start of an investigation
Q	the police officer who broke my arm should be charged with assault causing bodily harm at the very least
Q	the most disturbing thing about this is that they're behaving like it's a police state
Q	i'm a citizen of canada with charter rights i pay my taxes ergo i pay their salaries and they've sworn an oath to serve and protect me
Q	it has been my observation that in sensitive and serious investigations that the resolve of internal investigators to vigorously investigate their own members will too often stand in marked distinction to the approach the same investigators might take with a civilian accused of the same conduct

Q	epa's irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
Q	it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
Q	this air permit seriously undermines regional efforts to clean up the air and promote renewable energy projects
Q	if the coal plant is built it will add to health problems already facing tribal members and residents of both new mexico and colorado
Q	this is a political decision not one based on science or epa's own mandate
Q	epa ramrodded this permit out the door in response to a lawsuit filed by the coal plant owner whose lawyer jeff holmstead was a high-level epa official in the bush administration it looks like he's still giving orders to epa's staff
Q	what is particularly disturbing here
Q	is epa's rush to judgment on this permit decision sithe complains that the epa should have issued the permit several years ago but the whole reason this is taking so long is because the concept for desert rock is faulty epa still hasn't finished a thorough evaluation of the project but it's allowing a former agency official to bully it into rushing this permit out the door
Q	we plan to vigorously contest the permit to prevent a tremendous setback to the efforts of state and local governments and dedicated citizens to rein in global warming pollution and to protect the health of area residents

Q	intensive research has been devoted to the development of hypoglycemia alarms
Q	fully bio-compatible and patient-friendly alarm system
Q	hypoglycemia alarm dogs could provide an important aid to patients with poor awareness of symptoms particularly those prone to night-time episodes or who live alone
Q	pets may help patients with type 1 diabetes through aiding them when hypoglycemic
Q	increasingly frequent hypoglycemic episodes the past two years
Q	unusual stereotyped behavior
Q	peculiar behavior during the patient's hypoglycemic attacks
Q	reduced awareness of hypoglycemia and does not wake up during nocturnal episodes
Q	take canine glucose sensing to a new level of sophistication
Q	all were clearly able to sense hypoglycemia accurately under circumstances when the patients themselves were initially unaware of falling glucose levels
Q	formal calculations of sensitivity and specificity are not possible but each dog showed his or her specific behaviors only when the patient had documented hypoglycemia
Q	research is urgently needed to determine whether dogs can be trained to recognize and react to early signs of hypoglycemia
Q	dexter is my baby and has never sat on the couch with anyone but me
Q	if i am not in the room he sits on the floor
Q	she was only 48 mg dl
Q	she was not aware of her low blood sugar as soon as i fed her and got her blood sugars to come back up dexter was back on the floor laying in his usual spot
Q	i thought maybe it was just a coincidence but the next time i saw dexter sitting with becka and licking her face i immediately grabbed the meter even though it was not testing time
Q	she was 54 mg dl that time she had not felt any of these lows herself but the dog had
Q	becka knows that if dexter licks her incessantly to test her sugar and tell me or her dad
Q	every time he has licked her she has been low he seems to be able to pick up anything below 60 mg dl
Q	at first i thought it was just coincidence however it has happened too many times over the last three years
Q	i don't know if i thrash mumble snore or breathe differently when my blood sugar levels drop but regardless she is always pushing me with her paws
Q	she takes a running start and hits me with both her front paws
Q	frosty was a lifesaver in waking me up when i was sleeping and incurring a low blood sugar
Q	after a few weeks i realized that just before i did my finger sticks she began to whine and cry
Q	on days when i would tell her it's not good today she would bring me her rawhide chew
Q	when i have a hypo and head for the truck the young and middle-aged dogs follow and jump in excitement
Q	my cat angora whom i've had for about 15 years woke me up on one occasion by pawing at me and meowing to get my attention
Q	it was a time in my life before i was married and before i was in tight control so i didn't have very many lows

Q	early detection of diabetes has several benefits
Q	if the diabetes is recognized sooner it can be treated sooner this leads to a longer life a better quality of life and lower medical-related costs over the life span of the patient
Q	most patients we diagnose come to us because of a sudden change in vision maybe their vision is blurry and they have never worn glasses and they are concerned we are often the first doctor they see we end up being the ones who determine they have diabetes and refer them to other medical experts for follow-up treatment
Q	everybody has to get on the same page when it comes to treating the person with diabetes
Q	from the eye doctor the dentist the podiatrist and the family doctor to the endocrinologist we all have to know what's going on with the patient and the patient needs to understand the ramifications of the disease

Q	the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
Q	many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustn't be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
Q	the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
Q	this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
Q	left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances

Q	the commission's view is that it would not be able to issue finalised guidance in this area until the relevant primary legislation had received royal assent and the commission had carefully considered the wider context in which guidance would operate and consulted widely on the content of the guidance
Q	the commission also strongly supports the recommendation from the review of the 2007 scottish elections that no changes to the rules surrounding elections should be applied to an election held within six months of those changes coming into force
Q	it is a perfectly understandable reaction on the part of the electoral commission they could well end up in a situation where they are called on to address whether a candidate's expenses are political without legal clarity at which point they know they will face all sorts of challenges

Q	clunk click every trip
Q	the time for consideration of such a drastic measure has not yet been reached it would be premature at the present time strict enforcement would have undesirable effects on relations between police and public many of whom would justifiably resent prosecutions and convictions relating to failure to take precautions which in no way affect the safety of any other road users
Q	often cause compulsion to be resented
Q	there is no doubt that the police would incur unpopularity any further deterioration in the good relationship between police and public is to be deplored but it is difficult to see how this could be avoided
Q	a patrol car driver would have the additional difficulty of taking his eyes from the road to check vehicles which he passes
Q	dwarfs and persons who are deformed grossly obese exceptionally tall or have other permanent physical characteristics
Q	some old people opposed or indifferent to seat belts would deprive themselves of the pleasure they get from a car outing rather than put up with the nuisance involved in what they regard as an unnecessary newfangled idea most old people are law-abiding and the conflict between conscience and desire to go for a drive with the family is easy to foresee
Q	women who object to the feel of the belt over their breasts should not be exempted the evidence also indicates that if an impact is of sufficient force to kill an unborn child the collision would be of such severity that the mother would probably be killed unless she was wearing a seat belt a woman who wears a belt and survives while her baby dies does not sacrifice her unborn child's life she simply avoids the futile sacrifice of her own

Q	one of the biggest mistakes our school system has made in the last decade was eliminating the alternative school i think it would be awesome if you became an english teacher and brought back the alternative school your professional and academic success having come through an alternative school yourself would be an inspiration for many of the students who mistakenly believe or have been repeatedly told they have no value and no future as for teaching hunter s thompson i have doubts that the school board would approve this author even though his works have clear literary value because of the graphic and adult nature of his novels

Q	the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
Q	what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
Q	nickel oxide can't be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
Q	but our catalyst uses abundant materials that don't react with environment
Q	because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they don't need to be protected from environmental contaminants
Q	solar cell makers can add super-cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity

Q	world of warcraft
Q	stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime it's a crime in every system i know of taking property that's not yours that's a crime but when we're dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know what's somebody's and what's not somebody else's
Q	particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and that's nothing new we've done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal it's encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
Q	there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
Q	these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesn't allow it to occur the code doesn't function that way
Q	who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
Q	it's a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle it's a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
Q	congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments it's totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
Q	similarly they can say we're going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
Q	there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
Q	in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g-team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
Q	likewise our enforcement efforts deter inappropriate conduct
Q	as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but we're able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
Q	broadly offensive content
Q	virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
Q	avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault

Q	last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and it's part of an experiment they're doing they're trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
Q	the course is playing tough
Q	i'm not saying it's playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
Q	you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup that's as wonderful as this
Q	the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
Q	it was risky but it paid off
Q	the guy that's won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
Q	it's just a good course
Q	it's got length it's got rough it's got tough greens so you need to be on your game

Q	as i decided to put in some time and some work it certainly has made me gain a lot more desire to show my family who i am as a golfer
Q	at the open my finish wasn't the best and my scores weren't necessarily as good as they could have been but my two oldest boys were there and they finally got to see how i can hit a golf ball
Q	i've said for quite some time i've been playing quite well and not getting anything out of it
Q	i went there to royal birkdale feeling very good about my golf and i played quite well in very trying conditions for four days and took a lot out of it

Q	we've taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraoridnary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
Q	because property is a long-term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
Q	in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund

Q	i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
Q	i'm kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika it's a lot of hard work every time she tees it up she's expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
Q	i don't think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me i'm ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but it's not the end of the world for me
Q	i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
Q	and i like what i do so i just play i'm not sure that i'm going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then i'm going to re-evaluate and see but i'm getting close
Q	i was looking forward to a wonderful day but i've never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and it's driving me crazy
Q	i don't know what to do it's so disappointing that i can't post something low it seems like i can't play 18 holes

Q	we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
Q	he looked a little agitated but other than that he didn't look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
Q	according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
Q	they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we don't know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
Q	i'm not an officer but i don't see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i don't consider that a threat
Q	the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
Q	he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements he's also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
Q	it's a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt

Q	en lo que respecta a cruz azul todos sab amos que hay torneos importantes y que se report el equipo pensando en posible convocatoria y en la cantidad de partidos que iban a ver y parece algo raro por la cifra de jugadores que constantemente han sido llamados y que han sido pieza importante en la selecci n
Q	parece que en este momento le est n dando prioridad a los equipos para que puedan contar con plantel completo y en su momento seguramente habr bastantes convocados de este equipo
Q	lo m s bonito y que todo jugador quiere es estar en la selecci n y despu s competir en un mundial en este momento los clubes estar n agradecidos porque no se llevan a sus jugadores y pr ximamente habr oportunidad para que est n en la selecci n
Q	uno quisiera partirse en dos estar con la selecci n y con tu equipo porque son partidos importantes pero esas son decisiones que fueron tomadas por la gente de la federaci n y del cuerpo t cnico de la selecci n y no queda m s que acatar rdenes
Q	me da gran alegr a que haya sido convocado l leandro augusto porque es un gran jugador y uno de mis grandes amigos es un jugador que casi toda su carrera la ha hecho aqu y que ha rendido con creces creo que es un premio al esfuerzo y dedicaci n de toda su carrera
Q	est donde est uno debe tratar de responder yo esperaba la convocatoria y llegaron a un acuerdo la directiva de cruz azul y la fmf que les convenga tanto al equipo como a los jugadores
Q	hay varios torneos y eso es lo importante
Q	uno est bien y a gusto trabajando y ahora que viene este torneo hay que tratar de ganarlo

Q	lo nico que queremos aclarar es que hubo una propuesta de galatasaray de turqu a y es una oferta que tanto al jugador como para el club no es satisfactoria es a pr stamo cosa que no creemos sea la manera adecuada para el equipo y para ochoa
Q	estamos en la mejor disposici n de revisar propuestas y evaluarlas cuando tengamos algo que tanto al jugador como al club le llene el ojo vamos a tomar una decisi n
Q	pero sabemos de su inquietud tenemos que respetar su desarrollo profesional vamos a evaluar todo lo que llegue y lo vamos a apoyar en todo lo que se pueda hacer pero la idea es que cumpla su contrato hasta el 2010
Q	es atractivo pero no a pr stamo no es lo que queremos el equipo ni yo uno trabaja para conseguir cosas importantes y no estarse regalando creo que el futbolista mexicano debe darse su lugar y saber valorarse
Q	estoy muy tranquilo porque s que con el apoyo de la directiva siempre ha estado en la mejor de las disposiciones siempre se ha platicado acerca del tema siempre se va a acceder cuando sea algo que conviene a ambas partes

Q	the low road
Q	he's practicing the politics of the past john mccain
Q	his attacks on barack obama not true false baloney the low road baseless john mccain same old politics same failed policies
Q	barack obama supports a 1 000 middle class tax cut an energy plan that takes on oil companies develops alternative fuels and breaks the grip of foreign oil
Q	energy plan that takes on oil companies
Q	reduces our dependence on foreign oil
Q	taking the brand of a respected hero and diminishing him to a tabloid-stalker-type obsessed with a popularity they themselves will never have while blaming the person for his own status with no recognition just why that status has been bestowed by some people not everyone but the more they tell people not to like him the more petty and dishonest they reveal themselves to be especially after announcing they valued debating the issues with the public not debating q ratings with the glitterati
Q	trust us we know what you like just like iraq we were right there too if you didn't make money in the last 8 years you were lazy and we don't give a shit about your kind anyway
Q	my name is john mccain and i approve this message until i dis-approve of it later until i re-approve of it before my next dead and dying septuagenarian audience and a little blond girl asks me a question errrr something like that
Q	and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
Q	but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
Q	yet you continue to be more vocal against the black one
Q	the mccain camp wants voters to believe that obama's
Q	only a celebrity of john mccain's magnitude could star on blockbuster television shows like 24 and appear in big-budget motion pictures like wedding crashers
Q	these are not campaign commercials or news interviews but major hollywood productions which is no surprise given that he's pals with sylvester stallone arnold schwarzenegger and lorne michaels
Q	but obama's a socialist and an elitist
Q	after obamas speech to an estimated 200 000 germans in berlin a columnist for britain s guardian newspaper began his review this way barack obama has found his people but unfortunately for his election prospects they're german not american
Q	barack kant saves the world
Q	the man is perfect impeccable slick almost too slick obama's speech was often vague sometimes banal and more reminiscent of john lennon's feel good song imagine than of a foreign policy agenda
Q	john mccain is everyman like his hugging buddy george w bush
Q	this isn't a flip-flop it's a sex-change operation
Q	what i'm asking is does john mccain have the mental focus the intellectual discipline to avoid being out-slicked by barack obama if he isn't abandoned by his own voters
Q	does sen mccain know his own mind
Q	more evidence that sen john mccain is giving fits to many conservatives like those who comprise the wall street journal's editorial board they're asking aloud if he's stupid
Q	played the race card
Q	he doesn't look like those presidents on the dollar bills

Q	we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with estrogen but by enabling them to use the estrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
Q	we discovered that you can affect the estrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where it's needed to address memory and spatial learning
Q	estrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
Q	we wanted to come back and enhance the signaling pathway that makes estrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signaling pathway solely in the brain
Q	this research shows that when the estrogen receptor-alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
Q	this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two estrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly estrogen receptor-alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organization and function
Q	investigating the impact of genetically replacing the estrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioral levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of estrogen receptor alpha in mediating estrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
Q	from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the estrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
Q	the research brings up the idea that local activation of non-nuclear estrogen receptor-alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus

Q	i got calls telling me i was a piece of crap
Q	i got text messages telling me i hope you blow out your knee
Q	i need to stand up for what i know is right
Q	what is right
Q	i laugh at it
Q	it never wore on me those guys are a bunch of idiots
Q	let's just say it's a little unorthodox
Q	i never wanted to quit michigan
Q	but when i left ohio state was the only school i ever considered
Q	you're not going to let justin go to ohio state are you
Q	he's going to make his own decision
Q	ohio state shunned me
Q	bo took me in
Q	you're his father
Q	you don't let him go to ohio state tell him where to go
Q	that was definitely something in the back of my mind
Q	except for one game
Q	except for one game
Q	maize and blue through and through
Q	coach tressel is a total players coach
Q	he's a first-class guy and down to earth coach bollman is the same way
Q	total players coach
Q	one of the toughest things i've ever done was telling coach tressel i was going to michigan i loved those guys so much and had become so close
Q	he was horrible
Q	justin hated that
Q	i said you're not going to be a mike boren you're a different kind of kid i don't care if you play football or not what i care is if you do it you've got to give 110 percent
Q	from there he was a different player
Q	boren visited ohio state several times
Q	but he grew up as a michigan person and responded well to coach carr and his staff
Q	he put on a clinic
Q	the kid can play ball
Q	high-decibel hard-core sometimes-profane approach to coaching
Q	players want to be coached and have somebody take them to a different level than they can take themselves
Q	if people think that's demeaning they misunderstand us
Q	some people need that push that extra push
Q	you think you're giving it your all but your coach knows what you can do and what you can offer
Q	i don't think coach carr had favorites
Q	boren got yelled at like everybody else even though his dad played for bo
Q	was it my first choice hell no but i could have gotten acquainted
Q	when i get done with college football i'll let it out
Q	when i get done with college football i'll let it out
Q	my real friends are still my friends there just aren't many of them
Q	i'll always root for justin but i'll never root for ohio state
Q	tressel and his staff coach with class and emphasize education
Q	they put what's most important first each player is important there's no bashing of players you're not going to be belittled each player has feelings they treat each person with respect
Q	he didn't sleep more than a couple hours
Q	he plowed all the way until sunday and then drove back up to michigan
Q	i was sad to see coach carr go
Q	i was hoping rodriguez would keep some of his assistants
Q	as soon as i got my release papers i contacted ohio state and they welcomed me with open arms
Q	attn nfl justin boren is a quitter who could not handle the system
Q	justin boren deserves doom and unmitigated failure
Q	he enjoys people booing him
Q	he thrives on that the more michigan boos him the harder he'll work
Q	i think about that game almost every day
Q	it will be the happiest day of my life it's going to be crazy that's what i'm looking forward to and it's all the better it's in ann arbor

Q	right now bound gods is my main focus
Q	hopefully if it's successful we'll bring in another website and i will be in charge of the men's division
Q	when you say that it's very polished it's funny because that's my aesthetic also so it blends very well with kink com
Q	i'm trying to bring in huge porn stars big names and also i'm trying to discover new talent and we're going to mix it all together i'm getting the muscle boys the porn stars the boy-next-door the gym boy the leather boy the fetish boy i'm getting all types of men for the site
Q	these are big-time porn stars and i love working with them
Q	but i also love working with tober who has been doing it for so long he's on cruise control so i don't have to do much with him he's got skills and i just let him run with it
Q	chad is a top in vanilla porn so he has that dominant streak inside of him already
Q	all it takes from me is to show him the correct way of using a flog or a belt and to hit safely we have safety lessons before we start that's all it took and he went with it that's my job to bring out the sm and the sadistic side of these tops
Q	there's nothing like it on the web so they're just starving for this material
Q	there's nothing even worth watching
Q	i'd like to make it so that it has something for everyone the vanilla crowd who has never thought of bondage or sm but say you know i'm not really into that but that looks fucking hot
Q	i get email like that all the time
Q	this is san francisco where all the leather boys are and i want to bring in the leather community and embrace the leather community to be a part of kinkmen com and give me some feedback so it can be something for them also
Q	a place for them to for to and have discussions hopefully i can have meetings here in the armory for the leather community that they'll be happy with
Q	i can't believe that they're paying me for this i pinch myself every morning because it's just like a dream job for me
Q	everybody at kink is extremely supportive and i have total freedom and they support my artistic endeavors

Q	it's disappointing losing without getting broken but it's not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
Q	he served really well so it was always going to be a hard match
Q	there's always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
Q	so far it's ok
Q	i guess i'll analyze and assess my game after the us open for the moment it's just all a blur i mean it's so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row it's hard
Q	it's a tough trip we've got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
Q	i'm looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
Q	i don't know what to take out of this match
Q	there's always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well
Q	it wasn't an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
Q	maybe i got a little bit unlucky on a couple but he definitely served well in the last tiebreaker when i had three chances on second serves i wasn't able to get one when i really needed to be on even terms with him
Q	i guess that cost me the match which is hard to accept
Q	he's doing well and i have done well in the past as well
Q	this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think it's been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the us open
Q	i haven't played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence

Q	right back in it
Q	it was an important hour for us
Q	we're right back in it we've just got to go hard again in the morning
Q	i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant i think i went in to see him afterwards and i apologised it was just emotion i went in and shook his hand and we're friends again
Q	yorkers are probably a bit under-used at times i tried to slip a few in and it seemed coming out of the committee room windows they struggled to see them
Q	i don't think the light was an issue it was the dark windows above the sightscreen it was really just the yorkers
Q	bowled a fantastic spell
Q	with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game
Q	if we can get a hundred ahead hopefully our bowlers can get the ball in the right areas like fred flintoff did

Q	barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck it's divisive negative shameful and wrong
Q	i'm sorry to say that it is it's legitimate
Q	there's no place in this campaign for that there's no place for it and we shouldn't be doing it
Q	you know he's not patriotic enough he's got a funny name
Q	this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
Q	barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe they're using the same old low-road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
Q	low road express
Q	straight talk express
Q	we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
Q	i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
Q	if you came out here with us you'd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues

Q	playing the race card
Q	this is almost like once you accuse someone of racism and bigotry the facts become irrelevant
Q	using the race card
Q	i think that they played the race card on me and we now know from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along i was stating a fact and it's still a fact
Q	would use his race to scare up votes for john mccain
Q	we know what kind of campaign they're going to run they're going to try to make you afraid
Q	they're going to try to make you afraid of me he's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name and did i mention he's black he's got a feisty wife
Q	so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he's not patriotic enough he's got a funny name you know he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know he's risky that's essentially the argument they're making
Q	barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck it's divisive negative shameful and wrong
Q	it seems clear therefore that the race card has become a permanent part of obama's hand a wild card to be played whenever the spirit or the circumstances so moves him

Q	to delegitimize any line of attack against him
Q	doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
Q	i don't care whether it helps or hurts us
Q	a lie unresponded to becomes the truth
Q	tenor and the meaning
Q	i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
Q	say whatever you want about bill clinton
Q	but it's deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race-based was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
Q	i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidate's prospects
Q	they heard something that
Q	we weren't suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue
Q	i really can't speak to the mccain campaign's motives
Q	it's ridiculous it's offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it
Q	and did i mention he's black
Q	he injected this yesterday
Q	we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again
Q	we will not be smeared on this subject period
Q	for a guy who has actually been the victim of attacks like this with his daughter in south carolina that's unacceptable
Q	i believe the mccain camp recognizes they need to define obama and knock him on his heels every single day
Q	for a week he's been on defense
Q	it's the first time in a while and he doesn't like it
Q	these are the politics of nixon and atwater it's transparent it's indecent and it's most of all it's a sign of desperation
Q	i assume this is what passes for cleverness in the hapless mccain campaign that they think somehow it seems less racist to call obama a racist
Q	why should it be any surprise
Q	the only way he gets to that inject race into the campaign
Q	it's a very dangerous game
Q	it's unpredictable what it will do

Q	you said that negotiating with iran is pointless and then you went further you said that it was appeasement were you referring to senator barack obama
Q	you know my policies of hyper-partisanship hypocrisy and lying my a off in public haven't changed but evidently the political calendar has people need to read the speech you didn't get it exactly right either what i when i said that a dictatorship would be a hell of a lot easier as long as i was the dictator and when you know a leader of iran says that they want to destroy israel you've got to take those words seriously or when a leader of the most powerful nation in the world says i'll be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office and if you don't take them seriously then it harkens back to a day when we didn't take other words seriously it was fitting that i talked about not taking the words of adolf hitler seriously on the floor of the knesset but i also talked about the need to defend israel the need to not negotiate with the likes of al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and the need to make sure iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon
Q	negotiating with iran
Q	as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
Q	president bush never uttered the words barack obama
Q	repeatedly you've talked about iran and that you don't want to see iran develop a nuclear weapon how far away do you think iran is from developing a nuclear capability
Q	you know richard i don't want to speculate and there's a lot of speculation iraq and mushroom clouds appearing above american cities in forty-five minutes but one thing is for certain we need to prevent them from learning how to enrich uranium and i have made it clear to the iranians that there is a seat at the table for them if they would verifiably suspend their enrichment and if not we'll continue to rally the world to isolate them
Q	negotiating with iran is pointless
Q	we should mention we didn't just wake up on a monday morning and say let's call this a civil war

Q	early design guidance
Q	express opposition for the subterranean alley vacation proposed by conner homes in the junction
Q	the project will impact our ability to do business and will have severe negative economic effets on the businesses in the junction area this impact will be compounded by inhibiting the use of the alley during the proposed construction during this time we will not be able to access parking freely at the rear of the business along the alley way there will be the impact of not having the ability for customers to load and unload in the alley way and access the businesses this also will make it very difficult for deliveries to take place during the construction these daily deliveries are vital to sustaining the business along the alley way
Q	if conner does this it'll be the end of the businesses that will be the noose it will kill us
Q	the fire department even told us to paint our address numbers on the alley side because that's their first line of response
Q	this project has for the most part flown under the radar

Q	there is an enormous difference a literally life-and-death difference between individual bank failures and a systemic banking failure i do not believe we are facing a systemic banking failure but we are facing more individual bank failures beginning in december 2007 the federal reserve system has sold treasury debt whenever it has increased its purchase of questionable assets that it has bought from banks and large financial institutions it has unloaded about 40 of its holdings of liquid treasury debt this has kept it from inflating the money supply at a dramatic rate at some point it will run out of treasury debt to sell to the general public in order to offset the increase of its purchase of questionable assets held by the financial system at that point the great inflation will begin this could be a year away this could be a month away all we know is this when the federal reserve system runs out of treasury debt to sell its purchase of all assets will be inflationary the banking system as a whole is protected what is not protected is the purchasing power of the dollar
